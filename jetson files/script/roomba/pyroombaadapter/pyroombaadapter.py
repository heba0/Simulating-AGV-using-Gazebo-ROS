                                      The lowest musical note that Roomba will play is Note #31.
                                      Roomba considers all musical notes outside the range of 31 – 127 as rest notes,
                                      and will make no sound during the duration of those notes.

        :param list note_duration_list: Note Duration (0 – 255) The duration of a musical note,
                                        in increments of 1/64th of a second. Example: a half-second long
                                        musical note has a duration value of 32.

        Examples:
            >>> adapter = PyRoombaAdapter("/dev/ttyUSB0")
